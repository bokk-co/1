Presentation
=======
Bokk is a mobile android app designed to ease customers' bookkeeping for shopkeepers.
It is composed of a calculator, a ledger and a phone directory.
All the operations are registered in a digital book displaying key figures and analytics,
Providing quick check-up of customers' accounts and of business activites.

Building from the code written by Rahul Parsani for the material calculator (2014),
We are working towards integrating the ledger and phone directory components.
